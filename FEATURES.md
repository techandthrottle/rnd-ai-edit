| **Smart Silence Removal** | ‚úÖ Implemented | Uses multimodal analysis (video + audio + text) to intelligently remove dead air while preserving meaningful pauses. |
| **Filler Word Detection** | ‚úÖ Implemented | Identifies and removes filler words like "um," "uh," and "like."                                                      |
| **Smart Trim (Retake & Repetition Removal)** | ‚úÖ Implemented | Identifies and removes re-takes and repeated words or phrases to improve conciseness. |
| **Premiere Pro XML Export** | ‚úÖ Implemented | Generates a Premiere Pro compatible XML file with edit decisions for non-destructive editing. |
| **Content Classification**| ‚úÖ Implemented | Analyzes the transcript to classify the video as a "Podcast" or "Short-form" video and identifies key topics.         |
| **Automated B-Roll Suggestions** | ‚úÖ Implemented | Analyzes the transcript to suggest relevant B-roll shots with timestamps.                                           |
| **Speaker Diarization**   | ‚úÖ Implemented | Identifies and labels different speakers in the audio.                                                                |
| **Interactive Review & Editing** | üìù Planned    | Provides a web interface for users to review and approve AI-suggested edits before finalizing the video.            |
| **Task Queue (Celery & Redis)** | üìù Planned    | Replaces the current threading model with a robust and scalable task queue for background processing.                 |

**Status Legend:**
*   ‚úÖ **Implemented:** The feature is complete and available in the application.
*   üìù **Planned:** The feature has been discussed and is on the roadmap for future development.
*   In-Progress: The feature is currently being worked on.

## Future Development Ideas

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Generative Audio Correction** | üìù Planned | Allow users to correct misspoken words by typing the correction, which then generates audio in the speaker's voice (similar to Descript's Overdub). |
| **Advanced Audio Enhancement** | üìù Planned | Go beyond simple noise reduction with features like dynamic range compression, equalization (EQ), and de-essing to provide a "Studio Sound" experience. |
| **Recipe & Template Library** | üìù Planned | Allow users to save and reuse editing recipes, and provide a library of pre-defined templates for common video formats (e.g., "Podcast Cleanup," "TikTok Style"). |
| **Publishing & Integration Hooks** | üìù Planned | Add the ability to automatically publish the final video to platforms like YouTube or cloud storage, and send notifications via webhooks. |

### Explanations for Future Development

#### Key Concepts to Borrow or Expand Upon

1.  **"Overdub" / Generative Audio:**
    *   **Descript's Approach:** Allows users to type a word and have it generated in their own voice to correct mistakes without re-recording.
    *   **Your Opportunity:** This is a more advanced feature, but you could plan for it. A future version of your API could accept a "corrections" object in the recipe. For example: `{"timestamp": "00:01:15.230", "replace": "apples", "with": "oranges"}`. On the backend, you would use a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model (or a voice cloning model if you want to get advanced) to generate the new word and seamlessly patch it into the audio track.

2.  **Studio Sound / Advanced Audio Enhancement:**
    *   **Descript's Approach:** A single-click feature that removes background noise, echo, and enhances speaker voices.
    *   **Your Opportunity:** Your `apply_noise_reduction` is a great start. You can expand this into a more comprehensive `enhance_audio` step in your recipe. This could include:
        *   **Dynamic Range Compression:** To balance the volume levels.
        *   **Equalization (EQ):** To improve the clarity and richness of voices.
        *   **De-Essing:** To reduce harsh "s" sounds.
        You can add these as boolean flags in your recipe, giving users more granular control over audio quality.

3.  **Templates & Recipes:**
    *   **Descript's Approach:** Users can save templates for their projects (intros/outros, title cards, etc.).
    *   **Your Opportunity:** You are already doing this with your `recipe` object! You can build on this by creating a library of pre-defined, named recipes. For example, a user could send `{"recipe_name": "podcast_cleanup"}` or `{"recipe_name": "short_form_social"}` instead of a full recipe object. This would make your API even easier to use for common tasks.

#### Where Your API-First Approach Shines

Descript is a fantastic tool, but it's a self-contained, GUI-driven application. Your API-first approach gives you a different, and in many ways more powerful, angle.

*   **Automation & Scalability:** A developer could use your API to build a workflow that automatically edits hundreds of videos a day. This is impossible with a manual tool like Descript. Think of services that generate video content at scale (e.g., turning articles into videos, creating personalized marketing clips).
*   **Integration:** Your service can be a single, powerful step in a larger automated pipeline. For example, a workflow could be:
    1.  A video is uploaded to a cloud storage bucket.
    2.  A trigger (like a webhook) calls your `/process_video` endpoint.
    3.  Your service edits the video.
    4.  The finished video is uploaded to a platform like YouTube or a Learning Management System (LMS), and a notification is sent via Slack.
